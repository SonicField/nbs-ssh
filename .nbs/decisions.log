[2026-02-04 05:55] PROTOCOL ENGINE SELECTION
Context: Need to choose SSH protocol implementation - Paramiko vs AsyncSSH
Decision: Use AsyncSSH as the protocol engine
Implication: Get proper keepalive semantics with interval + count_max for freeze detection. Async-first design. Paramiko's set_keepalive() doesn't provide the same "fail after N unanswered keepalives" behaviour.

[2026-02-04 05:55] PYTHON VERSION
Context: Available Python version in ~/local/cpython
Decision: Use Python 3.12.12 (venv at ~/local/nbs-ssh/venv)
Implication: Free-threaded Python (3.14t) benefits mentioned in spec are optional future enhancement. Core work is async-first.
