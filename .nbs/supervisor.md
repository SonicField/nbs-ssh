# Supervisor: nbs-ssh

## Terminal Goal

Build an AI-inspectable SSH client library using AsyncSSH that provides exec, streaming exec, port forwarding, automated interaction (expect/respond), supervisor-managed reconnection, and evidence-first diagnostics (JSONL event logs, failure bundles) - all with falsifiable tests against a Docker-based chaos testing rig.

## Current State

Phase: PLANNING
Active workers: none
Workers since last check: 0

## Progress

[Track major milestones and questions answered]

## Decisions Log

See `.nbs/decisions.log`

## 3Ws + Self-Check Log

[Append after each worker completes]

<!--
Template for each entry:

### Worker: [name] - [date]

**What went well:**
-

**What didn't work:**
-

**What we can do better:**
-

**Self-check** (if workers_since_check >= 3):
- [ ] Am I still pursuing terminal goal?
- [ ] Am I delegating vs doing tactical work myself?
- [ ] Have I captured learnings that should improve future tasks?
- [ ] Should I escalate anything to human?

[Reset workers_since_check to 0 after self-check]
